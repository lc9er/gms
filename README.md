GetMyServer - little tool to help you keep track of your machines

## Purpose

Quickly retrieve server(s) by name, IP, role, etc. As my work environment has grown, it has greatly eased 
the burden of memorizing dozens or hundreds of instance names.

Inspired by Kevin Marquette's article, [Powershell: You need a Get-MyServer function](https://powershellexplained.com/2018-02-23-Powershell-Create-a-common-interface-to-your-datasets/)
